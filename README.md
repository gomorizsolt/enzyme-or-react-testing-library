# Enzyme vs RTL

- :heavy_check_mark: Basic stuff(rendering texts and components without complexity, e.g. no hooks and conditionals)
- :x: Fire user events(button clicks, input changes)
- :x: Props handling(receive texts, events and other values, render elements conditionally)
- :x: Stateless & stateful components(trigger instance functions, access & manipulate data, lifecycle hooks)
- :x: Hooks(most notably `useState` and `useEffect`)
- :x: Asynchronous events(fetch &Â promises)
- :x: Extras(snapshot generating)
