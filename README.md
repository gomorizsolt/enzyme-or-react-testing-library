## TODOs

- :heavy_check_mark: Basics(e.g. make sure the given text exists in the component)
- :x: Conditional component rendering(e.g. the component receives custom prop and renders values depending on the prop)
- :x: Stateless &Â stateful components
- :x: Hooks(most notably `useState` and `useEffect`)
- :x: Fire user events(click, input change)
- :x: Asynchronous events(built-in `fetch` and promises)
- :x: Snapshot testing
